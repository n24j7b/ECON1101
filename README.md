Course Description 
Economics   is   a   social   science   that   studies   how   people   make   decisions   in   a   world   with   limited resources and the ways in which they interact with one another.
The   goal   of   this   course   is   to   provide   you   with   the   basic   tools   to “think   like   an   economist” – that   is, to be able to use basic economic principles to ask and answer questions about   how the world works   and   what   is   the   intended   and   unintended   effects   of   various   policies.We   will   cover   topics   such   as   how   individuals   or   frms   make   decisions   about   the   demand   for   or      supply   of   a   product, how   we   can   determine   the   efciency   of   a   market, and   how   we   evaluate   the costs   and   benefts   of   trade   or   government   interventions   in   the   society.
Course Aims
